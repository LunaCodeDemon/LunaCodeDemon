## Hi there 👋
I am a trained computer scientist that started out as self-tought programmer, I will always try to sharpen my skills.

![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=chinocodedemon&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=gruvbox&hide=stars)

 I’m currently working on the Discord Bot [Aeses](https://github.com/ChinoCodeDemon/Aeses), It's entirely free to use and to self-host.

 If you have ideas for me I am always open and will find solutions to implement those into my future projects.

I also suggest going on my [Gitea server](https://git.serx.it/explore/repos), for a different and more organized view over my projects (without forks and contributions).
_Please note that Github pushes will be seen as untrusted on Gitea_
