## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a trained information technology / computer science assistant that started out as self-tought programmer, I will always try to sharpen my skills.
My freetime I spent with learning new skills, like reverse engineering and artificial intelligence.
Since I have thought bursts, I often think about solutions to future problems that could lead to innovation.

My goal in life is to become one of the best software developers in the world, refining my experience with every day,
Currently I am struggling to get into the apprenticeship I devoted my life for, so I will search until I find a place that accepts my skills.
Autism makes it really hard to get a job, even when the problem comes with talents.

## My limits
I stay away from illegal ways of using my talent for computer science, even if it limits what I could learn.
In my opinion using the skills to take apart software and/or hardware in a way that hurts economy is a bad thing to do.
The projects I publish, distribute or share are for legal use only.

 Iâ€™m currently working on the Discord Bot [Aeses](https://github.com/LunaCodeDemon/Aeses), It's entirely free to use and to self-host.

 If you have ideas for me I am always open and will find solutions to implement those into my future projects.

I also suggest going on my [Gitea server](https://git.aciralith.com/explore/repos), for a different and more organized view over my projects (without forks and contributions).
_Please note that Github pushes will be seen as untrusted on Gitea_
